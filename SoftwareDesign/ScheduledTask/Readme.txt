In the presentation, each student will choose a design pattern himself (topics NOT covered
in the class), read it thoroughly and discuss its intent, motivation, structure, consequences
and known uses in the class. The design pattern can be selected from research articles or
other reference material found in library or internet. 


Each presentation must follow a demonstration of
an application that utilized the design pattern. The demo must contain proper mapping of
design pattern classes to concrete classes.
