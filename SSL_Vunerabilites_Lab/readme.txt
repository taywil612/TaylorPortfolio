The objective of this project was clear: conduct experiments to unearth flawed apps set up proxies to monitor HTTPS packages, identify sensitive information within data packages, and ultimately distinguish flawed or malicious applications.

In summary, our study into mobile application security has given our team valuable insights into the vulnerabilities present in this digital realm. Despite testing ten applications, only one exhibited flaws in its security measures concerning user data. This outcome underscores the unpredictable nature of identifying flawed apps merely by visual inspection. Intriguingly, our findings suggest a nuanced landscape, with applications within the Google Play Store appearing more susceptible to vulnerabilities compared to their counterparts in the Apple Store. This distinction highlights the importance of robust security protocols for developers and the necessity for users to exercise heightened caution, particularly when engaging with apps on certain platforms. As we reflect on our project, we recognize the dynamic challenges inherent in safeguarding user data and advocate for the continued lookout for possible security concerns and research in the pursuit of strengthening the security of all mobile applications across various platforms.
