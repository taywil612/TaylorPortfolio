In this task, we will investigate the impact of network delays and delay variations on
applications like voice over IP and time-sensitive financial transactions.

We will focus onchanges in network delays and jitter over a wide range of Internet paths and analyze them over
time. We will observe how routing changes can result in a rise in roundtrip delay for converged
paths. To identify network issues, we will employ the traceroute utility (for Linux systems) and
the tracert utility (for Windows systems), as well as the ping utility.

Our goal is to assess link latency for a five-day period and investigate how the latency and number of hops differ
throughout the day and week.
