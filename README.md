# My Portfolio
Hi, my name is Taylor Williams and I am a current student at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, majoring in computer and information science.


**About Me!**
- Currently, I am a senior and expect to graduate in the spring of 2024 
- I've always been interested in computers, gaming, writing, and reading. I'm always up for learning new skills and growing myself as a person. I am creative but also practical, I was in theatre and marching band in high school.
- I would also definitely consider myself a fast learner!
- Computer Science background, most proficient in programming languages: C++ and Python 
- I also have experience in other languages such as SQL/SQLite, Java/Javascript, and HTML/CSS

- Microsoft Visual Studio + Microsoft Visual Studio Code
- Microsoft Office + Excel + Powerpoint + Word
- Oracle + SqlDeveloper, for creating a database system
- Git/Github, for group collaborations

- Enterprise Architecture, for creating different types of software models and diagrams
- Jenkins, a continuous software integration tool
- Bitvise SSH client and WinSCP, for working with different servers
- Eclispe IDE, for java implementation
- Docker, for working with different operating systems
- Oracle VM Virtualbox, for creating and implementing proxy servers to test security measures of different mobile applications

- Practical Computer Security
  - **Project Associated**
     - SSL Vulnerabilities Lab: Conduct experiments to unearth flawed apps set up proxies to monitor HTTPS packages, identify sensitive information within data packages,
       and ultimately distinguish flawed or malicious applications.

- Mobile App Design 
  - **Project Associated**
     - DiceGame: A simple two-player game to help children practice arithmetic. There will also be a die (singular of dice) image that will determine what type of problem the players have to solve.
     - Newsapp: A simple app I created that generates random news for its users. Users can view a random news article's description, title, and author via a news API (NewsData.IO).
