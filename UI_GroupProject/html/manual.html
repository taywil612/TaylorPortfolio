        <p>The Website Accessibility Checklist (WAC) was created to help its 
            users determine how accessible a website is. On the home page, 
            there is a questionnaire, and each question on the questionnaire 
            has three potential answers: yes, no, and n/a. By answering these 
            questions for a target website, you can evaluate its accessibility.</p>
        <p>First, answer every question on the home page with yes, no, or n/a. 
            Questions given the n/a answer are not used in the website evaluation.</p>
        <p>If you are confused or want more information about a question, you can 
            hover over the question mark icon that is at the end of each question. 
            This will reveal a hint that elaborates the question.</p>
        <p>When you are finished answering questions, click the submit button. 
            You will be redirected to the results page where you will receive the target’s: 
            accessibility score as a percentage and their accessibility rank as text and on a scale.</p>
        <p>For questions that were given a no answer, tips for improving the target’s 
            accessibility will be provided. You can implement these tips and complete 
            the questionnaire to get a new score!</p>
