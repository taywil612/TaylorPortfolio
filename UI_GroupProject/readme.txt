The goal of this software is to facilitate the assessment process of a website by using an accessibility checklist in the form of a questionnaire. It will allow the 
users to evaluate the quality and effectiveness of an app. This will be achieved through a website that allows users to answer questions regarding the organization 
and presentation of content, the functionality of website components, efficiency of use, ability to find relevant information, as well as overall aesthetics. These 
questions will be evaluated and interpreted to provide the user with a score that shows the quality of the accessibility of the website.
